To fix:
Clone currently clones the Rc, i.e. only the pointer, not the node itself.

High-level options:

1) Continue with Rc<RefCell>, but hide introduce a wrapper class that hides the top-level Rc
so that Add can be Wrapper + Wrapper -> Wrapper.

2) Use Ids_
type Id = usize;
pub struct Tree {
    descendants: BTreeMap<Id, Node2>,
    root: Option<Id>,
}


3) Use raw pointers.


TODO:
* Make SnailfishNumber Copy? Or Clone? Replace manual constructions.
* Get rid of the redundant Rc.
* Perform parent pointer checks only for debugging. find ifdef debug equivalent?
* Use a logging library to print lines for debugging only.
* Implement again using raw pointers.
